# Image captioning with PyTorch (mainly focused on reinforcement learning)

work is still in progress

## Main Requirements
- Python >= 3.7 (Anaconda recommended)
- Java >= 1.6 (for nlg-eval)

## Setup
- Use `environment.yml` if you are a conda user
- Run `python -m spacy download en
- Install `nlg-eval` (instructions [here](https://github.com/Maluuba/nlg-eval/README.md))

## TODO
- [ ] Implement dataset loading for MSCOCO
- [ ] Add basic training code (models, loss)
- [ ] Add evaluation (BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, ...)
